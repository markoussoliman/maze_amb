# Project
A Scheme solution to solve an nXm maze by finding the correct path from the Start point to the End point. 

# Maze Builder & Approach
We generate a maze using Recursive Division Algorithm implemented in Scheme 

# Maze Solver & Approach
We generated a code to solve nXm maze utilizing a non-deterministic Algorithm that uses amb evaluator, Current Continuation and Continuation Passing concepts.
